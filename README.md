🐱 CatBoost Classifier and Regressor in Machine Learning
📘 Overview

CatBoost (Categorical Boosting) is an advanced gradient boosting library developed by Yandex. It is designed to handle categorical features automatically and provides fast, accurate, and easy-to-use implementations for both classification and regression problems.

CatBoost is based on the principle of gradient boosting over decision trees but improves upon traditional algorithms (like XGBoost and LightGBM) by:

Reducing overfitting,

Handling categorical data efficiently,

Supporting GPU training,

Providing robust default hyperparameters.

🚀 Key Features

Automatic handling of categorical variables (no need for one-hot encoding).

Fast training and prediction with optimized gradient boosting.

GPU acceleration for large datasets.

Support for both classification and regression tasks.

Built-in cross-validation and feature importance tools.

Handles missing values internally.

🧠 Working Principle

CatBoost builds an ensemble of decision trees sequentially, where each new tree corrects the errors of the previous ones using gradient descent optimization.

For categorical features:

Instead of label encoding or one-hot encoding, CatBoost uses a statistical approach called ordered target statistics or mean encoding.

It prevents overfitting by using a permutation-driven approach to calculate category averages during training.

⚙️ CatBoost Classifier

Used for categorical or binary target variables (e.g., predicting disease presence, sentiment classification, fraud detection).

Key Parameters:

iterations: Number of boosting rounds.

learning_rate: Step size for each iteration.

depth: Depth of each tree.

loss_function: Default is Logloss for binary classification.

eval_metric: Metric used for evaluation (e.g., Accuracy, AUC).

Advantages:

Works well with categorical data without encoding.

Less prone to overfitting.

Performs better on small to medium datasets than many other boosting models.

📈 CatBoost Regressor

Used for continuous target variables (e.g., predicting house prices, temperature, or sales).

Key Parameters:

iterations: Number of boosting iterations.

learning_rate: Step size shrinkage for each iteration.

depth: Maximum depth of the trees.

loss_function: Default is RMSE for regression tasks.

Advantages:

Handles non-linear relationships well.

Robust against outliers.

Provides smooth and stable predictions.

📊 Model Evaluation Metrics
For Classifier:

Accuracy – Measures the correctness of predictions.

Precision, Recall, F1-score – For class imbalance.

AUC-ROC – Measures the classifier’s ability to separate classes.

For Regressor:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
R² Score – Indicates model fit quality.
